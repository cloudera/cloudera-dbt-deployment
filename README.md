# Overview

To use dbt core and the adapters to build their transformation pipelines, a lot of scaffolding needs to be available. Cloudera has identified the requirements of such a scaffolding to enable secure and simple workflows for analysts and has provided guides to bring up such a scaffolding natively within the  Cloudera Data Platform. 
 - Multiple Environments 
 - Isolated development workspaces CI/CD pipeline
 - Orchestration 
 - Easy access to documentation 
 - Web-based UI to develop, & deploy in one place
 - Easy access to logs 
 - Monitoring & alerting 
 - Managed software artifacts

In this repository we have provided assets for various deployment methods. Currently we have assets for yarn deployment and soon we will also add assets for airflow based deployment.
